# Amiya

Yet another **experimental** middleware-based minimalism async HTTP server framework, most API design learned from Tide.

Working in progress, just alpha stage now, missing many features.

## Test

```bash
$ git clone <this-repo>
$ cd amiya
$ cargo run --release --example hello
```

Then in another shell:

```bash
$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/'
Hello from Amiya!
```
